Here's a test of a code block on my website:

```python title="code_example.py" {1-3}
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(10)
b = np.arange(10) ladkjflasd fl jlkajdsf laksjdf lkjadlf jlksjd lfjalskdj flkasjdflkjldk jlk falksjdflkajsdfl kjlsdkfjlsk djfl sdf
np.vstack((a, b))
```

Here, I am adding some additional content to test the spacing of paragraphs. This paragraph should be a fair distance from the code block above.
Let's see where this text on a newline ends up.

And finally, one more paragraph.

More.

And more.

I'm just trying to test scrolling.

```ts title="ts_thing.tsx"
<Element />
```

And even more.
