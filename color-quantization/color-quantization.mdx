To inaugurate this blog, I'd like to present a simple article involving a topic I've spent
many months studying: **clustering**. While the application to color quantization is
not complicated, it will serve as an excuse to show off the fancy formatting and data visualization tools
I've included in this site.

Let's inspect the following image:

<MdxImage 
    filePath='color-quantization/code/Brachyscome_iberidifolia_Toucan_Tango_2zz.jpg'
    alt="Brachyscome iberidifolia"
    maxWidth={1000}
/>

If you were asked to list the prominent colors in this image, how would you respond?
At a minimum, I would identify:

1. Green (background foliage)
2. Light Violet (flower petals)
3. Yellow (flower centers)

Fundamentally, this image is an array of pixels. The color of each pixel is described by
a combination of three integers, each in the range 0-255. You know this as **RGB**
color encoding. Pure black is encoded as (0,0,0) and pure white as (255,255,255).

Knowing this, we can determine the number of unique colors in this image by counting the
number of unique RGB triplets:

```python title="python"
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import numpy as np

url = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Brachyscome_iberidifolia_Toucan_Tango_2zz.jpg'

# Wikimedia access requires a user agent
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'DataDiary/0.1 (jared@datadiary.dev)'
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
image = image.convert('RGB')

image_array = np.array(image)
height = image_array.shape[0]
width = image_array.shape[1]
image_array_flat = image_array.flatten().reshape((
    height * width,
    3
))

view = image_array_flat.view((
    np.void,
    image_array_flat.dtype.itemsize * image_array_flat.shape[1]
))
num_colors = len(np.unique(view))

print(image_array_flat.shape, num_colors)
```

This reports 665,000 pixels with **141,862 unique colors**. More than you thought, right?
What if we were operating under strict storage/bandwidth limitations? Could we
devise a simple compression technique to reduce the size of this image while
maintaining the original resolution? You already employed a clever strategy
at the beginning of this article: reduce the diverse color space to a handful
of prominent representative colors.

### K-Means Clustering

How can we algorithmically identify the most faithful representatives of our color
space? The prevailing solution is **K-Means clustering**. We start by choosing the
number of colors to appear in our compressed image, *n*. We randomly cast out *n* points,
called **centroids**, into the color space. Then, we repeatedly run the following two steps to guide
the centroids to popular pockets of the space:

1. Assign each point (pixel) to the nearest centroid.
2. Move each centroid to the **mean position** of the points that are currently assigned to it.

The animation below shows three centroids gravitating to three natural clusters with this simple logic:

<MdxImage 
    filePath='color-quantization/code/K-means_convergence.gif'
    alt="K-means convergence animation"
    maxWidth={512}
/>

Let's give this a try on our image. We configure K-Means with 3 centroids and iterate until convergence.
We then replace the color of each pixel with the color of the nearest centroid:

```python title="python"
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(image_array_flat)
centroids = np.round(kmeans.cluster_centers_).astype('uint8')

quantized_image_array_flat = centroids[labels]
quantized_image_array = quantized_image_array_flat.reshape(image_array.shape)

quantized_image = Image.fromarray(quantized_image_array, 'RGB')

quantized_image.save('Brachyscome_iberidifolia_Toucan_Tango_2zz_KMEANS3.png', 'PNG')
```

<MdxImage 
    filePath='color-quantization/code/Brachyscome_iberidifolia_Toucan_Tango_2zz_KMEANS3.png'
    alt="Brachyscome iberidifolia KMeans=3"
    maxWidth={1000}
/>

Not exactly worthy of a postcard. What happened here? We can visualize the final positions
of the centroids in the color space to better understand this result:
